Reports <code>clone()</code> methods which are not declared as throwing
<code>CloneNotSupportedException</code>. If <code>clone()</code> is not declared
to possibly throw <code>CloneNotSupportedException</code>, then subclasses which need to
prohibit cloning will not be able to do so in the standard way. This inspection will not report
<code>clone()</code> methods declared <code>final</code>,
or <code>clone()</code> methods on <code>final</code> classes.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate if this inspection should only warn on <code>protected</code> methods.
In <i>Effective Java, Second Edition</i> (but not in the first edition) it is recommended to omit the <code>CloneNotSupportedException</code>
declaration on <code>public</code> methods, because methods that don't throw checked exceptions are easier to use.

<p>Example</p>
<pre><code>
  public class Example implements Cloneable {
    protected Object clone() { // method doesn't have 'throw CloneNotSupportedException' clause, so inheritors can't throw it
        try {
            return super.clone();
        }
        catch(CloneNotSupportedException e){
            return null;
        }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
